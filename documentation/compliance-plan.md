# Compliance Checklist for Patient Lab (UBC GenAI Policy & FIPPA)

## UBC Generative AI Policy Alignment

- **Complete UBC Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) for AI use** – Initiate and complete a UBC PIA for the application’s use of generative AI (OpenAI API). UBC requires a PIA for any tool handling personal information, especially if data will be stored or processed outside Canada ([Changes to FIPPA Data Residency Restrictions | Privacy Matters](https://privacymatters.ubc.ca/resources/bill22#:~:text=requirements%20www,the%20information%20outside%20of%20Canada)) ([UBC Privacy Compliance Guidelines | Learning Technology Hub](https://lthub.ubc.ca/support/privacy/#:~:text=Changes%20to%20FIPPA%20in%20November,UBC%E2%80%99s%20privacy%20and%20security%20standards)). This ensures the AI-powered features are reviewed for privacy/security risks and comply with UBC’s Generative AI guidelines and FOIPPA.  
- **No personal data in AI prompts unless approved** – Configure the AI simulation so that **no confidential or personal information** (e.g. student names, IDs, contact info) is sent to the OpenAI API unless the PIA explicitly allows it ([](https://it-genai-2023.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2024/08/PRINCIPLES_FOR_MITIGATING_RISKS.pdf#:~:text=Privacy%20Risk%20Mitigation%20Do%20not,any%20other%20toolset%20that%20has)). By policy, UBC faculty/staff should *not* input student-created content or any non-public data into generative AI tools that haven’t passed a PIA ([](https://it-genai-2023.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2024/08/PRINCIPLES_FOR_MITIGATING_RISKS.pdf#:~:text=Confidentiality%20of%20UBC%20Data%20Do,student%20essay)) ([](https://it-genai-2023.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2024/08/PRINCIPLES_FOR_MITIGATING_RISKS.pdf#:~:text=Privacy%20Risk%20Mitigation%20Do%20not,any%20other%20toolset%20that%20has)). In practice, ensure prompts only contain fictional patient data and de-identified user inputs.  
- **Obtain necessary consent or provide notice to users** – Inform students and faculty using Patient Lab about the AI component and how their data (e.g. chat content) is used. While recent FOIPPA changes mean storing data outside Canada no longer strictly requires student consent ([UBC Privacy Compliance Guidelines | Learning Technology Hub](https://lthub.ubc.ca/support/privacy/#:~:text=amounts%20of%20personal%20information%20should,students%20if%20data%20is%20stored)), it’s good practice to be transparent. Consider adding a usage agreement or a syllabus note indicating that the tool uses an AI service (OpenAI) and that by using it, users consent to their **anonymized** input being processed for educational purposes.  
- **Align with UBC’s GenAI ethical guidelines** – Ensure the AI’s use in Patient Lab follows UBC’s principles for responsible AI. For example, maintain human oversight of AI outputs and verify the **accuracy and appropriateness** of the AI-generated patient responses ([Principles - Generative AI](https://genai.ubc.ca/guidance/principles/#:~:text=Accountability%20for%20Results)). Faculty should review and test AI-driven scenarios for biases or incorrect information before student use, in line with UBC’s guidance to mitigate AI bias/incorrectness risks ([](https://it-genai-2023.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2024/08/PRINCIPLES_FOR_MITIGATING_RISKS.pdf#:~:text=Generative%20AI%20is%20an%20evolving,Key)) ([](https://it-genai-2023.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2024/08/PRINCIPLES_FOR_MITIGATING_RISKS.pdf#:~:text=Information%20Security%20Risk%20Mitigation%20Ensure,To%20maintain%20the%20security%20of)). All AI-generated content used in teaching should be vetted so it does not conflict with academic integrity or patient safety standards.

## FIPPA-Compliant Data Handling & Privacy

- **Limit collection and use of personal information** – Identify all personal data the system will handle (e.g. student names, CWL IDs, chat logs). Collect **only what is necessary** for the educational purpose and use it **only** for that purpose (training and assessment in clinical simulations) ([Guide to Good Privacy Practices - Province of British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy/good-privacy-practices#:~:text=In%20most%20cases%2C%20you%20can,the%20individual%20has%20consented%20to)) ([Guide to Good Privacy Practices - Province of British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy/good-privacy-practices#:~:text=Personal%20information%20may%20only%20be,the%20authority%20for%20the%20disclosure)). Avoid including real patient personal info – use simulated data. Ensure any analytics on chat data are done in aggregate or with identifiers removed when possible to protect student privacy.  
- **Data residency and storage location** – Host all application data in **Canadian AWS regions** (such as Canada Central or West) to keep data under Canadian jurisdiction ([Canada Data Privacy - Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/canada-data-privacy/#:~:text=The%C2%A0AWS%20Global%20Infrastructure%20%20gives,see%20the%20%20112%20webpage)). Although FOIPPA’s data residency restriction was lifted in 2021, storing student personal information in Canada is a prudent way to minimize privacy risks. If any personal data will be disclosed or stored outside Canada (e.g. via the OpenAI API in the U.S.), ensure this is addressed in the PIA with a documented risk-benefit analysis ([Changes to FIPPA Data Residency Restrictions | Privacy Matters](https://privacymatters.ubc.ca/resources/bill22#:~:text=maintain%20data%20residency%20in%20Canada%2C,the%20information%20outside%20of%20Canada)) and that mitigations are in place.  
- **Data transfer and disclosure compliance** – Ensure **all transfers of personal information** are authorized under FOIPPA. For instance, sending de-identified chat content to OpenAI should be justified as necessary for the app’s educational function (Section 33 of FOIPPA). Do not disclose identifiable student data to any third party without proper authority or consent ([UBC Privacy Compliance Guidelines | Learning Technology Hub](https://lthub.ubc.ca/support/privacy/#:~:text=,not%20be%20emailed%3B%20Microsoft%20OneDrive)). For LTI and CWL integrations, limit the information passed (e.g. use student ID or alias instead of full name if possible) and ensure the receiving system is trusted.  
- **Privacy notice and consent** – Include a clear **privacy notification** on the Patient Lab platform. State the legal authority for collecting personal info (e.g. FOIPPA s.26(c) for educational programs), the purpose of collection (simulation training and assessment), how it will be used/disclosed, and whom to contact with privacy questions ([eLearning Site Redesign | UBC CPD](https://ubccpd.ca/elearning-site-redesign#:~:text=Get%20the%20latest%20CPD%20in,your%20inbox)). This fulfills FOIPPA’s notice requirements and keeps users informed. If any optional features use personal data (e.g. experimental AI analytics), allow users to opt-in or obtain consent as needed.  
- **Data retention and disposal** – Establish a retention schedule for personal data. If chat transcripts or logs could be used to make academic decisions about a student, retain them for **at least one year** after last use ([Guide to Good Privacy Practices - Province of British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy/good-privacy-practices#:~:text=Personal%20information%20must%20be%20retained,make%20a%20decision%20affecting%20them)) (a FOIPPA requirement) so students have an opportunity to request access. Avoid indefinite retention of personal information; once data is no longer required for its purpose (and any mandated retention period has passed), securely delete or anonymize it. Document and enforce this data lifecycle (e.g. purge transcripts older than a set number of years, except where needed for institutional record-keeping).  
- **Secure data handling and sharing** – Handle personal data with care to prevent unauthorized access or exposure. For example, if instructors can export chat transcripts, provide this via a secure download within the app (after login) **instead of email**, since email is not a secure method for sensitive data ([UBC Privacy Compliance Guidelines | Learning Technology Hub](https://lthub.ubc.ca/support/privacy/#:~:text=disclosed%20without%20their%20consent.%20,students%20if%20data%20is%20stored)). If transcripts must be shared, use UBC-approved secure file storage (e.g. OneDrive or encrypted storage) rather than sending raw files over insecure channels ([UBC Privacy Compliance Guidelines | Learning Technology Hub](https://lthub.ubc.ca/support/privacy/#:~:text=disclosed%20without%20their%20consent.%20,students%20if%20data%20is%20stored)). Ensure any data transfers (to analytics tools, backup storage, etc.) are encrypted and restricted to authorized recipients.

## Encryption and Security Standards

- **Encrypt data in transit** – Enforce **TLS 1.2+ encryption for all network communications**. This includes the web interface (HTTPS for all user access and LTI launches), API calls to and from the application, and integration with OpenAI’s API (use HTTPS endpoints) ([Canada Data Privacy - Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/canada-data-privacy/#:~:text=Entities%C2%A0subject%20to%20Canadian%20privacy%20laws,its%20security%20and%20compliance%20obligations)). Any user authentication (CWL SSO) or LTI credential exchange must occur over secure channels to prevent eavesdropping.  
- **Encrypt data at rest** – Enable strong **encryption for all stored data** in AWS. Use AWS KMS-managed keys (AES-256) to encrypt the RDS database storage, backups, and snapshots, as well as any S3 buckets used for file storage ([Canada Data Privacy - Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/canada-data-privacy/#:~:text=Entities%C2%A0subject%20to%20Canadian%20privacy%20laws,its%20security%20and%20compliance%20obligations)). Likewise, if using EBS volumes for EC2 instances or container storage, turn on volume encryption. This ensures that if the storage media were compromised, the data remains protected. UBC guidelines require that personal info only be stored on encrypted systems ([UBC Privacy Compliance Guidelines | Learning Technology Hub](https://lthub.ubc.ca/support/privacy/#:~:text=disclosed%20without%20their%20consent.%20,students%20if%20data%20is%20stored)), so verify that all services (databases, file storage, logs) meet this standard.  
- **Key management and encryption standards** – Follow best practices for encryption key management. Use **unique encryption keys** for different data stores where appropriate and store/manage keys in AWS KMS or a UBC-approved key escrow service ([CSP - IT Rep - Cryptographic Controls | Privacy Matters](https://privacymatters.ubc.ca/csp-it-rep-cryptographic-controls#:~:text=)) ([CSP - IT Rep - Cryptographic Controls | Privacy Matters](https://privacymatters.ubc.ca/csp-it-rep-cryptographic-controls#:~:text=Further%2C%20If%20an%20encryption%20key,may%20result%20in%20data%20loss)). Limit access to encryption keys to only essential administrators. Ensure compliance with UBC’s **Information Security Standard M7 (Cryptographic Controls)** for managing certificates and keys ([CSP - IT Rep - Cryptographic Controls | Privacy Matters](https://privacymatters.ubc.ca/csp-it-rep-cryptographic-controls#:~:text=For%20the%20UBC%20Systems%20under,Cryptographic%20Controls)) ([CSP - IT Rep - Cryptographic Controls | Privacy Matters](https://privacymatters.ubc.ca/csp-it-rep-cryptographic-controls#:~:text=The%20X,information%20unreadable%20by%20unauthorized%20individuals)) – for example, obtain TLS certificates through UBC’s central CA or ensure third-party certs meet UBC’s cryptographic requirements.  
- **End-to-end protection** – Implement encryption **end-to-end** for user data. For instance, when a user enters chat text, it should travel over TLS to the app, be stored encrypted in the database, and if sent to OpenAI, be transmitted over TLS. Likewise, any analytics or transcript exports should remain encrypted during transfer and storage. This holistic approach ensures compliance with FOIPPA’s mandate to make *“reasonable security arrangements”* against unauthorized access or disclosure ([Guide to Good Privacy Practices - Province of British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/services-for-government/information-management-technology/privacy/good-privacy-practices#:~:text=Security)).  
- **Device and backup encryption** – Ensure that any device or medium on which data might be stored is encrypted. Administrators or faculty downloading transcripts or analytics to their computers must use UBC-encrypted devices (per UBC policy) ([UBC Privacy Compliance Guidelines | Learning Technology Hub](https://lthub.ubc.ca/support/privacy/#:~:text=disclosed%20without%20their%20consent.%20,students%20if%20data%20is%20stored)). If backups are stored outside the primary system (e.g. in S3 or offline), those backups must also be encrypted and stored in Canada or in an approved secure location. Document the encryption in place for all backups, exports, and archives of the system’s data.

## Approvals and Documentation Workflows

- **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) approval** – Obtain formal approval of the PIA from UBC’s privacy authorities (e.g. Privacy Matters office). The PIA process will document what personal data is involved and ensure alignment with FOIPPA. *No production deployment should occur until the PIA is reviewed and signed off* ([Changes to FIPPA Data Residency Restrictions | Privacy Matters](https://privacymatters.ubc.ca/resources/bill22#:~:text=use%20any%20electronic%20system%20or,the%20data%20is%20adequately%20secured)) ([Changes to FIPPA Data Residency Restrictions | Privacy Matters](https://privacymatters.ubc.ca/resources/bill22#:~:text=If%20you%20are%20undergoing%20an,CWL%20login%20required)). Be prepared to conduct an additional **risk-benefit analysis** as part of the PIA if sensitive personal info will be stored outside Canada ([Changes to FIPPA Data Residency Restrictions | Privacy Matters](https://privacymatters.ubc.ca/resources/bill22#:~:text=maintain%20data%20residency%20in%20Canada%2C,the%20information%20outside%20of%20Canada)). The PIA documentation should detail how data is collected, used, secured, and any risk mitigations – keep this on file as a compliance record.  
- **Security assessment and architecture review** – Engage UBC IT Security (Cybersecurity) for a security review or **Threat Risk Assessment (TRA)** of the application architecture. Document the system design (AWS architecture, data flow, security controls) and have it reviewed for vulnerabilities or compliance gaps. This may be part of the PIA or a separate process. Incorporate any recommendations (for example, additional encryption, monitoring, or access controls) and record the resolution of those recommendations.  
- **Approvals for third-party services** – Since Patient Lab uses third-party services (AWS and OpenAI), ensure you have the necessary institutional approvals or contracts in place. Leverage UBC’s agreements: for AWS, use UBC’s enterprise account or agreements if available, and ensure the AWS **Data Processing Addendum** is accepted to address privacy/security responsibilities ([Canada Data Privacy - Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/canada-data-privacy/#:~:text=The%C2%A0AWS%20Data%20Processing%20Addendum%20,and%20security%20of%20personal%20data)) ([Canada Data Privacy - Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/canada-data-privacy/#:~:text=Do%20any%20Canadian%20privacy%20laws,personal%20information%20to%20be%20encrypted)). For OpenAI, review its terms of service and privacy policy for compliance: confirm that data submitted via the API will not be used for other purposes (OpenAI allows opting out of data retention for API usage). If needed, get a **contractual commitment from OpenAI** (or use an approved vendor arrangement) that aligns with UBC’s privacy requirements. Document these reviews and any agreements in the project records.  
- **Documentation of compliance measures** – Maintain clear documentation of all privacy and security measures implemented. This includes the design of encryption, access control configurations, data flow diagrams (showing where personal data resides), and policies around logging and retention. Such documentation should be included in the PIA report or appended to it. Also document user-facing policies: create a brief **Privacy Policy** or Terms of Use for the application that codifies how data is handled in compliance with UBC and FOIPPA rules (this can be posted on the app for transparency). Keeping thorough documentation will help demonstrate compliance if audited and will guide future developers/administrators of the system.  
- **Ongoing review and updates** – Treat compliance as an ongoing process. Plan to **revisit the PIA and documentation annually or whenever the application changes significantly** (e.g. new features or new data collected). If OpenAI or AWS services change their terms or if laws/policies update, update your compliance approach accordingly. Document any changes or new risk assessments. UBC’s Generative AI guidelines note that the AI landscape evolves, so staying current is part of remaining compliant ([Principles - Generative AI](https://genai.ubc.ca/guidance/principles/#:~:text=Understanding%20and%20Remaining%20Current%20with,Generative%20AI)) ([Principles - Generative AI](https://genai.ubc.ca/guidance/principles/#:~:text=Appropriate%20and%20Responsible%20Use)). Regularly scheduled reviews and updates to documentation ensure continued alignment with UBC policy.

## AWS Configuration and Services

- **Use UBC-approved AWS accounts and region** – Deploy Patient Lab in a **UBC-managed AWS account** (under UBC’s AWS organization or control) if possible, to leverage centralized security controls and management. Choose AWS Canada (Central or West) as the primary region for all resources to keep data geographically in Canada ([Canada Data Privacy - Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/canada-data-privacy/#:~:text=The%C2%A0AWS%20Global%20Infrastructure%20%20gives,see%20the%20%20112%20webpage)). Verify that no AWS service you use stores data in another region by default. Using a Canadian region also helps meet UBC’s preference for local data residency and simplifies the compliance scope.  
- **Secure VPC network setup** – Run the application in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with proper network segmentation. Place servers and databases in private subnets (no direct internet access), and use a public subnet only for a load balancer or bastion if needed. Configure **security groups** and network ACLs to allow only necessary traffic: e.g. web ports (443) from UBC networks or the internet to the load balancer, application server access to the database on its port, and **block all other inbound access**. This network isolation helps prevent unauthorized access to data.  
- **Managed AWS services (RDS, S3)** – Use **AWS RDS** for the application database to benefit from its managed security features. Enable Multi-AZ deployment for high availability and turn on automated backups (with backups encrypted and stored in Canada). Use parameter groups to enforce secure database settings (e.g. SSL connections to the database). For file storage (cases, attachments, or exported transcripts), use **Amazon S3** with buckets set to **private** (no public read access) and bucket policies that only allow the app or authorized users to access the objects. Enable versioning or lifecycle rules on buckets as appropriate for backup and retention needs. These managed services will simplify meeting encryption and reliability requirements.  
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** – Implement strict IAM controls for AWS resources. Follow the principle of least privilege: define IAM roles for the application servers that only permit necessary actions (e.g. an EC2 role can read from a specific S3 bucket for case data, but not list all buckets). Use IAM roles for any Lambda or container tasks instead of long-lived AWS keys. For human access, create distinct IAM users or roles for administrators (with MFA enforced) and avoid using the root AWS account except for initial setup. Regularly review IAM policies to ensure no overly broad permissions. AWS provides fine-grained control – leverage that to limit who (or what service) can access sensitive resources ([Canada Data Privacy - Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/canada-data-privacy/#:~:text=,security%20measures%20to%20prevent%20unauthorized)).  
- **AWS logging and monitoring services** – Enable **AWS CloudTrail** across the account to log all API calls and changes ([Operational Checklists for AWS](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_Security_at_Scale_Logging_in_AWS_Whitepaper.4059194c4532b49a4fd68e8f62e9bac545635ef8.pdf#:~:text=The%20logging%20and%20monitoring%20of,service%20that%20records%20API%20calls)). Configure CloudTrail to store logs in an S3 bucket (encrypted) that only security admins can access. Consider enabling CloudTrail **log file validation** to detect any tampering ([Operational Checklists for AWS](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_Security_at_Scale_Logging_in_AWS_Whitepaper.4059194c4532b49a4fd68e8f62e9bac545635ef8.pdf#:~:text=The%20logging%20and%20monitoring%20of,service%20that%20records%20API%20calls)). Use **Amazon CloudWatch** for real-time monitoring: set up CloudWatch Logs for application logs and enable metrics/alarms (e.g. high error rates, unusual traffic spikes). Utilize **AWS CloudWatch Alarms** to get notified of potential issues (such as sudden increases in CPU, or unauthorized attempts picked up by logs). You can also enable AWS **GuardDuty** for threat detection in your AWS environment (to catch things like anomalous API calls or malware communications) as an extra layer of security monitoring.  
- **AWS configuration and compliance tools** – Leverage AWS config rules or security services to enforce compliance. For example, use **AWS Config** to continuously check that resources remain encrypted, S3 buckets aren’t made public, CloudTrail is enabled, etc. Enable **AWS Security Hub** or similar to get a unified view of compliance against standards. These services can alert you if something drifts from the secure baseline (e.g. if an S3 bucket policy is misconfigured). Additionally, maintain an **isolated environment setup**: separate AWS accounts or at least separate VPCs for dev/test vs. production, to prevent non-production activities from affecting production data. Each environment should meet the same baseline security configurations.

## Logging and Monitoring Protocols

- **Comprehensive audit logging** – Implement logging at both the infrastructure and application levels. At the AWS level, CloudTrail (as noted) will capture all AWS console/API actions for auditing ([Operational Checklists for AWS](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_Security_at_Scale_Logging_in_AWS_Whitepaper.4059194c4532b49a4fd68e8f62e9bac545635ef8.pdf#:~:text=The%20logging%20and%20monitoring%20of,service%20that%20records%20API%20calls)). At the application level, ensure Patient Lab itself logs important events: user logins (CWL authentication events), LTI launch events, access to cases, and chat sessions start/stop. **Log administrative actions** (e.g. case content creation by faculty, transcript exports, any impersonation or override actions) with timestamps and user IDs. These logs create an audit trail to investigate incidents or student inquiries. Make sure log entries are detailed enough to trace “who did what and when,” but **avoid logging sensitive content in plain text** (e.g. don’t log passwords or unnecessary personal info).  
- **Protect log data** – Treat logs as sensitive data since they may contain personal information (e.g. student IDs, chat content). Store logs securely (for instance, in CloudWatch Logs or an encrypted S3 bucket accessible only to the ops team). Apply a retention policy to logs – keep them long enough for audit requirements and troubleshooting (often 1 year or more for audit logs), then purge or archive to cold storage. Monitor access to logs: only authorized administrators or auditors should be able to read them, and access to raw logs should itself be logged (for example, CloudTrail will log if someone opened the log bucket or queried CloudWatch).  
- **Real-time monitoring and alerts** – Set up monitoring on key aspects of the application to catch issues early. Use CloudWatch metrics and custom metrics from the application to watch for anomalies (e.g. a sudden spike in chat activity or errors might indicate misuse or a bug). Configure alerts for security-relevant events: for example, alert if there are repeated failed CWL login attempts (possible attack), or if the application logs show an unusual pattern (like a user exporting many transcripts rapidly). Utilize AWS CloudWatch Alarms, SNS, or other notification services to ensure the right personnel are alerted (e.g. email or PagerDuty notification to the support team) when thresholds are breached.  
- **Privacy and security incident monitoring** – In addition to performance, monitor for privacy/security incidents. Use AWS services like GuardDuty to detect suspicious AWS account activity (e.g. a user performing anomalous actions). Consider employing a **web application firewall (WAF)** to log and block malicious web requests to the app (SQL injection attempts, etc.). Review application logs for any unauthorized data access — for instance, log whenever an instructor accesses a student’s transcript, and regularly review those logs or set alerts if an account accesses an unusually high number of records. This proactive monitoring can help catch insider misuse or account compromises early.  
- **Regular log review and testing** – Establish a routine (e.g. monthly) for the devops or IT security team to **review logs and monitoring dashboards**. During these reviews, check for any errors, security warnings, or anomalies that might have been missed by automated alerts. Also, periodically test the logging and monitoring setup itself: e.g. simulate an unauthorized access attempt to verify that it is logged and that an alert is generated. This ensures your logging/monitoring is not only in place but effective. Document the outcomes of log reviews and any incidents, as this supports continuous improvement and accountability.

## Role-Based Access Control & Audit Logging

- **Implement application-level roles** – Define clear roles within Patient Lab (e.g. **Student**, **Instructor**, **Administrator**) and ensure the system enforces role-based permissions. Students should only access their own simulation activities and data; instructors can access data for the students in their course (e.g. view their chat transcripts for evaluation), and administrators or support staff have access only as needed to manage the system. Use the CWL authentication and LTI context to assign roles automatically (for instance, trust the LMS to designate instructor vs. student in an LTI launch, or use group information from CWL if available). Verify that **no sensitive functions are accessible to unauthorized roles** (for example, a student should not be able to view another student’s transcript or modify case content).  
- **Least privilege principle** – Both at the application and AWS level, grant the minimum access necessary. Within the app, if there are features like case authoring or data export, restrict them to authorized faculty or admin accounts. For database access, use separate accounts/credentials for application vs. admin access, and do not use a shared admin credential. On AWS, as noted, IAM policies should restrict each administrator or service to only the resources and actions they require ([Canada Data Privacy - Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/canada-data-privacy/#:~:text=,security%20measures%20to%20prevent%20unauthorized)). Periodically review user roles and permissions to remove any excess rights. This limits the damage that can be done if an account is compromised or misused.  
- **Strong authentication and session security** – Rely on UBC’s CWL SSO for user authentication to benefit from its security (including multifactor authentication where applicable and central user management). Ensure the **SAML/OIDC integration with CWL** is configured for strong security (validate tokens, enforce short token lifespans). For any admin accounts that are not through CWL (e.g. AWS console access or internal maintenance accounts), enforce multi-factor authentication and strong passwords. Implement secure session management in the app: use HTTPS-only cookies for session tokens, set appropriate session timeout and renewal, and log out users after inactivity.  
- **Audit administrative access** – Maintain an **audit log of administrative access and actions**. This means tracking not just system events, but who among the staff accessed what data. For example, if an administrator views a student’s chat record or a faculty member edits a case scenario, log that action (user, time, and what was accessed or changed). UBC’s privacy guidance emphasizes that personal information should only be accessed on a need-to-know basis ([UBC Privacy Compliance Guidelines | Learning Technology Hub](https://lthub.ubc.ca/support/privacy/#:~:text=,not%20be%20emailed%3B%20Microsoft%20OneDrive)), so the system should record when privileged users access student data to support after-the-fact review. These audit logs should be reviewed if there's ever a concern or complaint. They can be kept in the application database or sent to a secure log store where they cannot be altered.  
- **Regular access reviews and audits** – Establish a process to review who has access to the system and to what data. For example, each term or at set intervals, review the list of users with admin or instructor privileges and confirm they still require access (remove accounts for people who have left or no longer need access). Similarly, use AWS CloudTrail logs to audit that AWS console access and API keys are being used appropriately. UBC InfoSec standards (Standard U9 – Access Management) likely require periodic access recertification ([UBC Privacy Compliance Guidelines | Learning Technology Hub](https://lthub.ubc.ca/support/privacy/#:~:text=licenses.%20,details%20in%20place%20of%20the)). Conducting these reviews and addressing any discrepancies (removing old accounts, adjusting roles) will strengthen compliance and reduce risk of unauthorized access over time.

## Support and Escalation Planning

- **User support plan** – Set up a clear support structure for end users (students and instructors). Provide help documentation or an FAQ within Patient Lab on how to use the system and what to do if they encounter issues. Designate a support contact (e.g. an email or ServiceNow queue) for technical problems or questions. Ensure this support channel is monitored, especially during any critical course activities, so that issues (like inability to access the simulation or errors in AI responses) are promptly addressed.  
- **Technical support and maintenance** – Identify who is responsible for maintaining the AWS infrastructure and application code (e.g. a specific IT team or the developers in the faculty). Set up an on-call rotation or response plan for after-hours issues if the application will be used at off-hours. Subscribe to AWS service health alerts for the region and services you use, so the team gets notified of any AWS outages that could affect Patient Lab. Have a plan for applying updates and security patches to the application and its dependencies (schedule regular maintenance windows). All support personnel should be briefed on the privacy/security requirements so that any workaround or fix they implement continues to uphold compliance (e.g. not instructing a user to email a transcript).  
- **Incident response and escalation** – Develop an **incident response plan** specific to Patient Lab. This plan should outline steps to take if a security or privacy incident occurs, such as a suspected data breach, unauthorized access, or a critical failure of the AI system. Include **escalation contacts**: e.g., notify UBC Information Security (Cybersecurity) and the Privacy Office immediately in the event of a data breach or privacy incident (UBC has an incident reporting process via Privacy Matters ([Changes to FIPPA Data Residency Restrictions | Privacy Matters](https://privacymatters.ubc.ca/resources/bill22#:~:text=,74))). For less severe issues (like the application being down or a bug), define an internal escalation from tier-1 support to the development team or to AWS Support if infrastructure-related. Clearly document who the first responders are and how to reach them (phone numbers, emails), and ensure they know their roles.  
- **Breached data containment and notification** – As part of the incident plan, predefine how to contain and investigate a data breach. For example: if chat transcripts are found to be accessible by an unauthorized party, immediately restrict access (maybe lockdown the app), collect logs (CloudTrail, application logs) to determine scope, and involve UBC privacy officers to evaluate if notification to affected individuals is required under FOIPPA. Having a step-by-step plan will save time and ensure compliance with breach notification obligations. (Under FIPPA, while explicit breach notification rules are not as prescriptive as some other laws, UBC policy would likely require notifying affected students and possibly the IPC if a significant breach occurs.)  
- **Performance and scaling support** – Plan for how to handle support if usage grows or spikes (for instance, if an entire class of students uses the system at once). Use AWS CloudWatch alarms to detect when the system is under stress so the support team can proactively scale resources or intervene. Leverage AWS auto-scaling for servers if possible to handle load, and have the support team monitor during high-use sessions (like a class exercise) to ensure the AI responses are functioning. If the OpenAI API fails or rate-limits, have a fallback strategy (perhaps a cached response or a polite error message to retry later) so that student experience and learning isn’t completely disrupted. Communicate any major outages or downtimes to users promptly through appropriate channels (e.g. email instructors if needed).  
- **Continuous improvement and training** – Finally, incorporate feedback loops in your support process. After resolving incidents or receiving support requests, analyze them for root causes and improve the system or procedures. For example, if users frequently ask about privacy concerns, perhaps provide more upfront info; if an incident occurred because someone wasn’t aware of a procedure, improve training. Regularly train the support and admin team on privacy, security, and AWS management (ensure they know the importance of compliance and how to handle sensitive data). Keep an escalation chart handy and updated, so even new team members know how to escalate issues appropriately. By planning and training, the team will be prepared to support the application while maintaining UBC’s standards for privacy and security.
