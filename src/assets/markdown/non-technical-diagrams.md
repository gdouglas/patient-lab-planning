Here are several diagram types that can be very effective for explaining your Patient Lab project's architecture to a non‐technical audience:

1. **System Context Diagram**  
   - **Purpose:** Illustrates the big picture—showing the application at the center with its external systems (LTI/Entrada for primary authentication, CWL for individual access, OpenAI, D‑ID, and user devices).  
   - **Focus:** High-level interactions and data flows without technical jargon.

2. **High-Level Architecture Diagram**  
   - **Purpose:** Breaks down the system into its main components (React frontend with Redux, Shad UI, Tailwind, and Framer; FastAPI served by Uvicorn; WebRTC for voice communication with pending WebSocket implementation).  
   - **Focus:** Visualizes how each piece fits together with minimal technical detail.

3. **User Journey Flow Diagram**  
   - **Purpose:** Maps out the steps a user takes—from logging in via LTI/Entrada to interacting in a voice chat with the animated avatar.  
   - **Focus:** Emphasizes the user experience and the flow of interactions rather than technical backend details.

4. **Process Flow Diagram for Real-Time Communication**  
   - **Purpose:** Shows how voice-to-voice interactions happen end-to-end, including signaling (via WebSockets, implementation pending), voice data transmission (via WebRTC), and the role of external APIs (OpenAI for response generation, D-ID for avatar animation).  
   - **Focus:** Uses simple icons and arrows to indicate the sequence of actions during a conversation session.

These diagrams use clear, everyday language and intuitive visuals that help non-technical stakeholders quickly grasp the overall structure, how users interact with the system, and the flow of data between components. Would you like a sample sketch or further refinement on any one of these diagrams?
