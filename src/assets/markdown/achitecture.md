## 1. Systems & Components

### A. Frontend System
- **Components:**
  - **User Interface:**  
    - Chat windows and voice command interface  
    - Animated avatar display that "speaks" responses  
    - Controls for microphone input and audio playback
  - **State Management:**  
    - Centralized state handling using Redux for user sessions, ongoing chat data, and voice-to-text transformations
  - **Styling & Animation:**  
    - Shad UI components for pre-designed, high-quality UI elements  
    - Tailwind CSS for rapid, utility-first styling  
    - Framer for smooth animations and interactive transitions (e.g., animating the avatar)
- **Technologies Needed:**
  - **Framework:** React  
  - **State Management:** Redux  
  - **Styling/Animation:** Shad UI, Tailwind CSS, Framer  
  - **Voice Capture:** Browser APIs (e.g., Web Audio API) and integration with WebRTC for real-time voice streaming

### B. Backend API System
- **Components:**
  - **API Gateway & Business Logic:**  
    - Routes REST and WebSocket requests to appropriate endpoints for session management and conversation orchestration  
    - Implements business rules (e.g., prompt guardrails) and logs user interactions
  - **External Integrations:**  
    - **OpenAI API:** For natural language processing and generating conversational responses  
    - **D-ID API:** For creating or managing animated avatar video responses based on text inputs
- **Technologies Needed:**
  - **Framework:** FastAPI (to build the API endpoints, including async routes for real-time and background tasks)
  - **Web Server:** Uvicorn (to serve FastAPI in production)
  - **HTTP Client:** Asynchronous client (e.g., httpx) for communicating with external APIs
  - **Authentication Middleware:** Custom middleware for validating LTI launches and CWL sessions

---

### C. Real-Time Communication System
- **Components:**
  - **Voice-to-Voice Communication:**  
    - Real-time audio transmission between endpoints using WebRTC  
    - A signaling mechanism (using WebSocket connections) to establish and manage WebRTC sessions (implementation pending)
  - **Animated Avatar Integration:**  
    - The backend processes text (or voice-recognized input) and triggers an animated avatar via D-ID  
    - The avatar "speaks" the response, converting text to a synchronized audio-visual output
- **Technologies Needed:**
  - **Protocol:** WebRTC for real-time audio streaming  
  - **Signaling:** WebSocket (implementation pending)
  - **Avatar Animation:** Integration with D-ID API coupled with Framer-based animations on the frontend for a smooth transition effect

---

### D. Data Storage & Logging System
- **Components:**
  - **User & Session Data:**  
    - Stores chat transcripts, session metadata, and interaction logs for analysis and debugging
  - **Media Storage (if needed):**  
    - Temporary storage of generated video URLs or cached media
  - **Vector Storage:**
    - OpenSearch Service for RAG-powered preceptor resource recommendations
- **Technologies Needed:**
  - **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS
  - **Cloud Storage:** AWS S3 (for media assets; optional if caching is desired)
  - **Vector Store:** OpenSearch Service
  - **Monitoring:** To be determined

---

### E. Deployment & Hosting System
- **Components:**
  - **Containerized Backend Deployment:**  
    - Running your FastAPI application in containers for ease of management and scaling
  - **Traffic Routing & Load Balancing:**  
    - Secure, scalable handling of incoming traffic, including routing of WebSocket and HTTPS requests
- **Technologies Needed:**
  - **Container Orchestration:** AWS ECS Fargate (to run containers without managing underlying servers)
  - **Static Frontend Hosting:** AWS S3 combined with CloudFront (for a fast, global CDN)
  - **Load Balancing & DNS:** AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) for routing, HTTPS termination, and WebSocket support; AWS Route 53 for DNS management

---

### F. Authentication & Session Management System
- **Components:**
  - **User Authentication:**  
    - Primary authentication through LTI from the Entrada LMS
    - Individual CWL access available for specific users
  - **Session Persistence:**  
    - Issues JWTs or session cookies after successful authentication to maintain user sessions throughout interactions
- **Technologies Needed:**
  - **Protocols:** LTI for LMS integration and CWL for individual access  
  - **Session Management:** JWT tokens and secure cookie storage managed in FastAPI

## 2. Application Features

- **Dual Communication Modes:**  
  - **Voice-to-Voice Interaction:** Students speak, and the system processes voice input for real-time conversation  
  - **Animated Avatar Response:** The system generates synchronized audio-visual responses featuring an animated avatar that "speaks" the response

- **Conversational AI Integration:**  
  - **Response Generation:** Utilizes OpenAI to generate context-aware conversational replies  
  - **Prompt Guardrails:** Enforces rules to maintain the integrity of the simulated patient interaction

- **Real-Time Interaction:**  
  - **WebRTC-based Voice Streaming:** Facilitates low-latency voice conversations in real time  
  - **WebSocket Signaling:** Manages connection setup, session control, and status updates for the voice channel

- **Case Authoring & Management (Faculty Tools):**  
  - **Authoring Interface:** Allows faculty to define cases, input scenario details, and set parameters for the conversation
  - **Session Logging:** Captures detailed logs of interactions for later review, analysis, or debriefing

- **Secure and Compliant Access:**  
  - **UBC CWL and LTI Integration:** Enforces secure, centralized authentication without relying on third-party systems like Cognito
  - **Data Logging & Monitoring:** Provides insights into system performance and user interactions for continuous improvement

- **Scalability & Resilience:**  
  - **Containerized Deployment via ECS Fargate:** Facilitates easy scaling and high availability of your API services  
  - **Load Balancing with ALB:** Ensures smooth traffic management and supports dynamic scaling, including WebSocket connections
